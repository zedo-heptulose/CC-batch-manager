bugs: 

seems to infinitely go on sometimes. Need to fix that.

other issue:
E_bs and E_singlepoint disagree somehow? this is very confusing...
check ORCA output interpretation before proceeding. Consider running a singlet and triplet singlepoint calculation separately at each geometry

several questions here:
where did the different and lower value for SP energy come from

FROM THE DISPERSION CORRECTION
which is solely a function of the coordinates (is this correct? look into parameters)
this is applied AFTER the broken symmetry magnetic coupling block
...as is the gCP correction.

check out the Frank Neese diradical character paper cited in the orca output file

are the natural orbital occupations printed in the output file?
no, but corresponding orbitals are. These might also be used to calculate gamma

can I calculate higher polarizabilities?


PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATIONS:
Postprocessing for parsed data to get basic derived values in the structured output
ensure we ask for printout of UNOs
:qa

would prefer to run these depth first, I can't do that much with 100 CREST runs..
maybe we can store jobs in a tree structure?

BUGS:
we run into the following problem:
on restart, the old ledger should overwrite the batchfile entries, but doesn't happen




FEATURES WANTED:
can we write submission scripts for the batch runner to directories?
I mean, can our input generator make these, so we aren't running
from the directory with all the source code?
