crash if job pending on ledger but not actually running
	-yeah just maybe tell people to change it to not_started if you cancel it
batch_runner generally doesn't do well when starting with jobs running and not
labeled as such, maybe we can fix this


xtb opt freq didn't change xyz coords properly-
scrap this whole system of editing files in place, honestly
	-high priority, will definitely mess people up


orca input generator swapped negative charges to positive? why? 
	-seems to have been a fluke, can't reproduce.
	-probably just actually had used a wrong keyword
	-and didn't overwrite it.

non-integer ids in legers?
	-doesn't seem to be affecting any of the functions of the batch runner
	-low priority
